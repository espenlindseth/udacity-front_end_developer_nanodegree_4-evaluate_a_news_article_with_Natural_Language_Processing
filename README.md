## Overview
This is a project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. This project was an assignment which mainly teaches Webpack, Webpack Plugins, Webpack Loaders, Sass. It also requires installing the Aylien API as an SDK. And to set up a node environment with express, configure get/post routes, use the fetch api to get the data from the Aylien API, and chain promises together to update the basic UI.

## Instructions
To run this, clone it or download the repo, make sure you have node installed. I used v10.15.3.

Then you may have to run these commands:
1.	npm install
2.	npm audit fix
3.	npm update
4.	npm i webpack webpack-cli
5.	npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader
6.	npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
7.	npm i -D webpack-dev-server
8.	‭npm i -D clean-webpack-plugin‬
9.	‭npm i -D style-loader node-sass css-loader sass-loader
10.	npm i --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
11.	npm i optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-plugin
